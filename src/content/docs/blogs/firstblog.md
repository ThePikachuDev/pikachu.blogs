# My First Blog Post

Published on:  2024-12-21

Welcome to my First blog post : ) 

# **What I've gonna do here ??** 

**Post about My ideas in my mind**: so i don't give a fuck about if anyone like it or not .I just want some place where i can express my thougths without any restrictions . as you can see , i can freely use any words i wanna use without restrictions and i also don't have any views,likes,shares or anything like that bull shit to worry about. thats just me 

# Why this site does not have any fancy animations and colors ?? 

I'v planned to make my own protfolio many times but every time i failed at design and ui [for example this](https://github.com/ThePikachuDev/Broken-portfolio-V1).One day i saw this person's [portfolio site](https://rcx86.me/?i=1) ( BTW his site is alot cleaner than mine tho and he is also a genius and good man) and got an idea to make my own site like this. The best thing about making this type of portfolio site that i can easily upload my blogs , projects without even thinking about ui , designs , responsiveness and all that crap. 


So that's it for this blog , i'll upload next blogs very soon
